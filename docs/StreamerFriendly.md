# StreamerFriendly

A plugin that prevents external services from tracking players via Steam Server Queries.

## How it works

Server information is publically expose by Steam through their [Server Queries](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Server_queries).

This plugin works by anonymizing the player names to the same name so that external services, such as BattleMetrics, are not able to track the players on your servers.

This is particularly useful for preventing players from abusing those services to stalk, harass, or stream-snipe other players on the server.
